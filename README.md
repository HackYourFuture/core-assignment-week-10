# Core program week 10 assignment

## Getting started

Install the dependencies before working on either task:

```bash
npm install
```

## Tasks

### Task 1 — Cocktail Recipe CLI

Build a command-line tool that fetches cocktail recipes from TheCocktailDB API and writes the results to a markdown file. You will work with `fetch`, `async/await`, and `fs/promises`.

See [task-1/README.md](task-1/README.md) for full instructions.

### Task 2 — Post Central API Services

Implement the service functions that connect a CLI app to a REST API server. You will make authenticated HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using `fetch` and JWT tokens.

See [task-2/README.md](task-2/README.md) for full instructions.
